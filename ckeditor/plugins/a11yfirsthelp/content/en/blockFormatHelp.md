## Block Format

### How it works

* A block format can be applied by placing your cursor within a text block and
selecting an item from the *Block Format* menu.

* The baseline block format is *Normal text*, which is a simple paragraph.

* To remove an active block format, either toggle it off by selecting it in the
menu, or select the *Normal text* option from the menu.

* Headings are a specialized type of block format used to label other text
blocks, and are specified using the *Heading* menu.

### Why it's important

* Thinking in terms of blocks within your document is a higher-level approach
to providing structure and semantics that are important for all users.

* When block formats are used properly (e.g. *Preformatted text* or *Address*),
they help users of assistive technologies understand the intended role of the
content.

* Visual styling for block formats is predetermined by your organization, thus
freeing up your time and energy for concentrating on the structure and meaning
of the content within your document.
