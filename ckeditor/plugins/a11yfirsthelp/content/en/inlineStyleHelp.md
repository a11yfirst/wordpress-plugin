## Inline Style

### How it works

* Inline styles have a different purpose than block formats. They are used
at a lower level to highlight words or phrases within blocks of text.

* To apply an inline style to existing text, select a range of text and then
choose an option from the menu.

* To apply inline styles to text you are about to type, choose an option from
the menu and begin typing. The style will continue to be applied until you
choose another option or move the cursor to a different point in the document.

* Multiple inline styles can be applied to selected text.

### Why it's important

* Thinking in terms of block formats first, and then using inline styles to
emphasize key words or phrases within text blocks, results in documents that
are easier to read and understand.

* Inline styles, when used properly, help screen reader users better understand
the types and meanings of lower-level stylistic changes within blocks of text.

* When block formats are considered as primary, and inline styles secondary,
many visual styling decisions are already made by default.

* When inline styles are used to change the styling of blocks of text, it
makes the document more difficult to read and understand within the context of
the website.

* Using block formats and inline styles properly will make it easier for you to
maintain stylistic consistency.
